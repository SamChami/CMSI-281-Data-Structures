# CMSI-281-Data-Structures

## Implementation of data types, information structures, and algorithms. Topics include: collection classes and interfaces for sets, lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries; implementation techniques such as arrays, linked lists, and efficient tree structures; introduction to computational complexity; elementary sorting; hashing.

### Projects coded in Java


#### Yarn
Data structure simulating the use of an array of an Entry class to track String inputs as well as the number of occurrences of each string.  

#### Linked Yarn
Data structure simulating using a doubly linked list. Linked Yarn is a linked list of Strands that stores a String of text as well as the number of times that string was added to the yarn.  

#### Web Navigator
Mock webpage navigator that simulates a user visiting a page navigating back and forward through their web history.  

#### Auto Completer
Use of a ternary search tree to suggest complete words for string inputs.
